When developing for the Web, lean into the platform.
Make the most of what it gives you.
The browser is Fortuna and she's throwing you a sytem that you need to work around.
But you should love the platform because it give you so much to work with.
Don't fight it.
Reinventing browswer behavior leads you down the same path as the dog tied to the cart that fights the rolling of the wheels.
