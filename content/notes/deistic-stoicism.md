Stoic Physics tells you what the system governing being is and how you should react to everything. It's a clear system. But the reason people struggle with it is because the experience of being embodied (having a body and existing in the physical world with a set of base desires we share with animals) causes us to struggle with the intellectually simple thing: making judgments. We know what we should do, but that's not what it feels like. Every member of the College can tell you how we should respond in any situation—how we should feel. But all of us still struggle with it. Merely knowing what to do isn't helpful when talking about the struggle to do the thing we intellectually know is correct. I've found the 18th century Deists and 19th century phenomenologists have developed better language for the experience of being than the Stoics. Also, the Deists read the Stoics and Heidegger was heavily influenced by Heraclitus. So while the three don't match up in every way, there are certainly ties between them and Stoicism.
