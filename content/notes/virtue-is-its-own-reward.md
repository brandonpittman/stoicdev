title: Virtue Is Its Own Reward

There's a website (claiming to be Stoic) that gets a lot of views (I won't mention it) and asks you to record your good deeds.
If you need to advertise your good deeds, you're not doing the deed to benefit the Cosmos.
You're doing it for your own ego.
It's a less glamorous version of naming a library after yourself.
We should benefit the Cosmos because that's our duty to the Cosmos.
Like Marcus said, "don't go looking for the third thing." _[Meditations 7.73]_

The kind of Stoics (I hesitate to use the capital "S" here) that ask you to look for public recognition of your good deeds are the same ones that denounce Stoic physics as backwards and superstitious.
They're the same people that have turned Stoicism into a business.
Do good deeds because they're the right things to do.
Don't post them on some Month of Service site.
Benefit the Cosmos because that's your duty to the god and to its constituent parts.
