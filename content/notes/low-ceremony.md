My guiding principle in choosing tools and systems is "low ceremony".
There's a tendency we all have to choose faffy solutions that promise to deliver on a lot of fronts but try to solve problems we don't have.
We reach for kitchen sink libraries that offer every helper function you can imagine when we only need one or two of the functions it provides.
We could copy and paste those one or two functions and own the code ourselves.
Are we worried the library will get updates we won't get automatically?
