Donald Robertson recently argued on his Substack that Stoic ethics can stand on their own without Stoic physics. Ethics follow from logic, he says, not from cosmology or theology. This makes Stoicism accessible to modern atheists and agnostics who don't want to deal with anything that smells like religion. He explicitly criticizes institutions like the College of Stoic Philosophers for insisting on the connection between physics and ethics.

I think he's wrong, and I think the error is fundamental.

## Logic doesn't generate content

Robertson conflates the _structure_ of Stoic philosophy with how its conclusions are actually _derived_. Logic in Stoicism is the method of reasoning, not the source of what you're reasoning about. It connects premises to conclusions. It doesn't create premises out of nothing.

The traditional derivation works like this:

**IF** the cosmos is rational, and humans are parts of a divine rational whole (Stoic physics),  
**THEN** via logical reasoning,  
virtue is the sole good and we should live for the benefit of the whole (Stoic ethics).

Robertson's move is to remove the IF clause and keep the THEN clause. But _therefore what?_ You can't derive conclusions from a method of reasoning any more than you can use mathematics to generate numbers from nothing. You need something to operate on.

He asserts that "excellence in reasoning is our good" follows from recognizing reason as our essential nature. Fine. But "reason is our nature" doesn't get you to Stoic virtue ethics. It could just as easily get you to Epicurean ethics, utilitarian calculation, or Aristotle's mean. Nothing about recognizing reason as essential tells you that virtue is the _sole_ good rather than one good among many, or that living according to reason means living for the benefit of the whole, or that wisdom, justice, courage, and temperance are the cardinal virtues rather than some other set.

These are specific Stoic conclusions. They require specific premises. In traditional Stoicism, those premises come from physics — understanding ourselves as parts of a rational, interconnected, providentially ordered cosmos. We should act for the benefit of the whole _because we are parts of that whole_, and the whole is rationally ordered. Take away the physics and you lose the derivation entirely. You're left with duties floating in a metaphysical vacuum.

## Aristo doesn't help

Robertson cites Aristo of Chios as evidence that Stoic ethics can function without physics. This is misleading. Aristo was explicitly criticized _by other Stoics_ for neglecting physics and logic. He was heterodox — an outlier who departed from what the school actually taught. Diogenes Laertius records that Aristo "did away with logic and physics" and that other Stoics regarded this as a fundamental error.

Modern Stoics love pointing to Aristo as proof that not everyone in the tradition agreed on this. Sure. But disagreeing with the majority still makes you the minority. One dissenter doesn't overturn two millennia of mainstream teaching.

## The Marcus Aurelius misread

This one comes up constantly. Modern Stoics cite the "providence or atoms" passages in the _Meditations_ as evidence that Marcus was agnostic about Stoic physics and practiced ethics independently of them.

That's not what Marcus is doing.

When he writes things like "if all is God, then all is well; but if ruled by chance, don't you too be ruled by chance" (9.28), he's employing a common philosophical technique — arguing from the weakest position to show his conclusions hold up even under the most skeptical assumptions. The Epicurean model (atoms, chance, indifferent gods) was the main competitor. By saying "even _if_ the Epicurean view were correct, virtue would still matter," Marcus is stress-testing his beliefs, not expressing doubt about them.

We know this because the rest of the _Meditations_ is saturated with references to Zeus, the logos, universal nature, and rational cosmic order. Pierre Hadot makes this point in _The Inner Citadel_ — Marcus consistently returns to the Stoic framework after these rhetorical explorations.[^1]

Here's the irony: this actually _supports_ the traditional position. Marcus felt compelled to address the Epicurean physical model precisely because he understood that different metaphysics generate different ethical frameworks. He wasn't saying physics doesn't matter. He was showing that even with the _wrong_ physics, virtue remains a rational choice. But he clearly believed the Stoic physics were correct.

## The evidence is thin

Modern Stoics lean so heavily on Aristo and the Marcus passages because they don't have much else. If Stoic ethics genuinely functioned independently of physics throughout the tradition, we'd expect abundant examples across the literature. Instead we have one heterodox figure who was criticized for his position, one rhetorical device that's been persistently misread, and then the vast majority of Stoic texts treating physics as foundational. From Chrysippus through Epictetus, mainstream Stoicism consistently derives ethics from physics. The outliers don't overturn that.

## The retrofit problem

Both modern Stoicism and historical deism run into the same structural issue: they're retrofitting ethical conclusions they already accept with alternative metaphysical foundations.

Deists said "we'll keep the Christian God but strip away revelation, miracles, and institutional church." Modern Stoics say "we'll keep these Christian-compatible ethics — virtue, duty, self-control, cosmopolitanism — but strip away the theological grounding." Both movements work backward from ethics they inherited culturally, then shop for foundations that are just enough to support those ethics while avoiding what they find uncomfortable.

The problem is that both approaches are parasitic on Christian culture. They're not actually deriving ethics from first principles. They're preserving familiar ethics while swapping out foundations.

Traditional Stoicism didn't have this problem. It derived its ethics from its understanding of cosmic and human nature as participations in divine reason. A genuinely fresh start from Stoic metaphysics might produce ethics quite different from what modern Westerners take for granted.

## Accessibility isn't an argument

Robertson worries that Stoic physics "puts off" modern audiences uncomfortable with religious frameworks. That's a practical concern about marketing, not a philosophical argument about what Stoicism actually teaches.

If Stoic ethics require Stoic physics for their derivation — and I think they do — then attempting to separate them produces something that isn't Stoicism. It's a modern invention wearing Stoic vocabulary.

The other thing worth noting: Stoic theology isn't what modern atheists are reacting against when they reject "religion." Stoic physics isn't belief in a personal God who issues commandments, or acceptance of divine revelation, or membership in an institutional church. It's rationalist metaphysics — the claim that reality has a rational structure you can understand through reason and observation. That's a very different thing from what most people mean by "religion."

## Follow the money

It's impossible for someone who disavows the possibility of religion, God, or providence to ever accept Stoic physics. The only way to keep marketing Stoicism to modern atheists and agnostics is to discredit the idea of Stoic physics. And that's not primarily a philosophical move. It's a commercial one.

Modern Stoicism has become a profitable industry — books, podcasts, conferences, apps, merchandise. The brand has value. "Stoicism" sounds serious and ancient. It has cultural cachet that "secular virtue ethics" or "rational self-improvement" doesn't.

But there's a dishonesty in using the term "Stoicism" — even qualified as "modern Stoicism" — when what's being taught is incompatible with the actual philosophical system. If the physics are truly dispensable, then what's being taught isn't Stoicism. It's something else borrowing Stoic vocabulary and aesthetic.

The honest move would be to call it something different. "Rational virtue ethics." "Philosophical resilience." Anything that doesn't claim continuity with a tradition whose core metaphysical commitments are being rejected. But that would sacrifice the brand. And the brand sells.

This creates a perverse incentive. The more successful modern Stoicism becomes commercially, the stronger the pressure to maintain the brand while diluting the content. And the more necessary it becomes to discredit traditional Stoicism — to paint people like Chris Fischer and institutions like the College of Stoic Philosophers as gatekeepers peddling unnecessary theology.

The deeper irony is that if Stoic ethics are really just common-sense virtue ethics any rational person would arrive at independently, the Stoic brand is unnecessary. The ancient Stoics weren't selling self-help. They were offering a complete philosophical system that explained reality, how humans fit into it, and therefore how we should live. The ethics followed from the metaphysics. Remove the metaphysics and you're left with ethical assertions that aren't distinctively Stoic.

## Where this lands

Robertson's article gives academic cover for a trend already underway — the gradual abandonment of Stoic metaphysics while preserving Stoic-flavored ethics. But it rests on a logical error: mistaking the structure of philosophy for the derivation of conclusions.

The question isn't whether you can practice Stoic-like ethics without believing Stoic theology. Obviously you can. People do it all the time. The question is whether that practice is _Stoicism_ or something else using Stoic vocabulary. I think the answer is clear.

_This is one perspective in an ongoing conversation within the Stoic community about the relationship between physics, logic, and ethics. It's a response to [Robertson's article][robertson], not a personal attack — it's a defense of traditional Stoicism's integrated system against attempts to break it apart._
